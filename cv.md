**About me** 
<br/> 
*At the moment I am actively studying English individually with a tutor (my level is Pre-Intermediate). There is little experience in active sales. I am ready to learn a new specialty. I guarantee responsibility and decency. I get along in any team, high neuropsychological stability. If necessary, I can take any place of service, work, study. I was not registered anywhere, I have not been brought to the police.*
